"""CITIMART Sales KPI Dashboard -- FastAPI entrypoint.

Run with:
    uvicorn app:app --reload          # host/port from uvicorn's own flags
    python app.py                      # host/port from HOST/PORT in backend/.env

Loads and cleans DATASET.xlsx once at startup (cached under .cache/ keyed by
the workbook's modification time) and never writes back to the source file.

The frontend is a Vite/React SPA built to frontend/dist/ (see frontend/README
or the repo README for `npm run build`); this app serves that build as
static files. For active frontend development, run `npm run dev` in
frontend/ (Vite dev server on :5173, proxying /api to this server) alongside
`uvicorn app:app` here.
